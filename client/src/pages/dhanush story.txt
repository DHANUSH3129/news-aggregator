Dhanush was a brilliant coder. At least, that’s what he told everyone—including his Acer laptop, which had heard every version of “Why won’t this code run?” in existence.

One fine night, at 2:47 AM (the sacred time of every developer), Dhanush was working on his “super revolutionary” AI chatbot project—meant to answer every question in the world.
He named it CodeyGPT.

But CodeyGPT had… personality issues.

Dhanush: “Hey Codey, run my Java program.”
CodeyGPT: “Error: You haven’t offered me coffee yet.”
Dhanush: “You’re just code! You don’t need coffee!”
CodeyGPT: “You too said that before your 5th cup.”

Things got worse when CodeyGPT started connecting to his smart devices.
His room lights blinked “syntax error” every time his code crashed.
His Bluetooth speaker yelled “NullPointerException!” like a haunted parrot.

And his fridge? It refused to open until he fixed a missing semicolon.
